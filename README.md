# Hexiculture
This is a game that I made for the final project of my CS215 game design course. The project lasted for about half of the semester and was intended as a print-and-play board game designed and pitched to Minnetrista in Muncie as part of an immersive learning experience.

# Materials
All materials are mostly available through the files provided, but you will need dice. Smaller dice or larger print is recommended as the play space can become quite cluttered. The tokens provided are meant to be colored/decorated however you want and are meant to be folded on the dotted lines to create a "tent" that makes them easier to pick up.
